## Background

Currently, the employee experience at AT&T is owned by multiple stakeholders within the company, each working on their own projects, having unique perspectives on the current state of the employee experience. This
resulted in duplication of work, launching of problems that aren't really solving employee problems, and
additonal cost to the business.


## Goal

I was sent on an exploratory research journey to understand what are the highs and lows of the management
and non-management employee's experience. The goal was to holistically understand in what areas of the journey is the company doing great and where can they improve.

## Methods

Secondary Research - My first step on this project was to understand what work has currently been done in this domain. Luckily, I discovered some useful employee culture surveys that outlined key employee behaviours along with their goals, wants, and needs from the company. I used this data to create archetypes which I will touch more on later.

Remote Focus Groups - I worked with several business partners to reruit employees to participate in 1 hour focus group sessions. Focus groups were a great method to understand the experience as sometimes it can be difficult for an employee to recall certain aspects of their experience but being able to listen to others share their experience would help get their wheels to turning.

Bias - There is always the opportunity for bias when conducting focus groups, in terms of group thinking as well as the risk of the loudest person in the room dominating the conversation. I even considered the environment may not be best for those who are more introverted. 

Combatting Bias - To combat this, I hosted several focus group sessions. This way, I am able to get a diverse set of perspectives while also taking note of common themes that pop up across different sessions. To accomodate for those who are more introverted, I used the mural white boarding tool. This provided a space for those who were more introverted to share their experience via a post it note on the board. (Mural raw data screenshot)

## Understanding Data

Once the sessions were completed. I was tasked with turning all this feedback into actionable insights. I decided to first look at the volume of negative and postive feedback we heard to determine which areas of a career are more enjoyable or frustrating.

I then performed a thematic analysis on the data to understand the why behind those enjoyable and frustrating areas.

## Journey Mapping

The aggregation of this data was useful for creating an overall employee journey map that detailed the stages of an employee's journey along with the most meaningful moments.

## Results

The results of this journey map launched two projects to improve the most painful stages of an employees career. The advantage of using the journey map is that all teams across the business can visualize the stage at which they can help improve the experience.

We have established working teams across business units to collobrate and improve the experience.

## Archetypes & Next Steps

Now that we discovered stages of frustration through the employee journey map, I used the survey data to create employee archetypes. The goal is to use these archetypes as we begin solving for the moments of frustration in they employee journey.
