# Peek: Movies & TV Shows

Note: This post serves as a condensed version of the case study I am currently in the process of writing.

## Challenge

The original task was a broad hackathon challenge--create a website that displayed media. My partner and I brainstormed potential problems people faced when online. We decided to tackle the problem of people finding things they would like to watch on streaming platforms.

## About the Problem

People have difficulty finding shows they would like to watch on streaming platforms. The myriad of options on streaming platforms adds to that difficulty. Although such platforms have a recommendation system, people  like to ask their family and friends for recommendations.

## Research & Design Methods Used

Field study, survey, competitive analysis, persona building, task analysis, prototype feedback & testing, user stories, qualitative usability testing, feedback review.

## My Role

I led the research, recruited usability participants, and consulted with my team on design matters and designed high-fidelity wireframes mock-ups for the system.

## Outcome

We created an iOS application, Peek, where people can send and receive movie and tv show recommendations from their family and friends.  Peek is currently available on the App Store and was awarded with a BIT Award from Howard University Computer Science and sponsored by Google.
