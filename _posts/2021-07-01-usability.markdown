## Background

Internal communication sites help improve employee engagement while also helping employees stay up to date on company news & events. In an effort to reduce development costs, a decision was made to migrate our in house communcation site and mobile application to the cloud. I perfomed usability testing on the new, consolidated application to ensure that users would still be able to achieve their goals on this new site.

## Recruitment

For this evaluation, I was interested in two user groups - casual users and super users. Both groups were determined by users level of engagement on the site. A participant screener was created to segment the users into both groups. In addition to this survey, I worked with the marketing team to ensure we were selecting the correct super users.

I followed the industry standard of gathering 5 users for usability testing in order to discover 80% of usability problems. I found this method to be both effective and insightful. Each user presented new usability problems, but the amount of new problem decreased as we tested with more users.
 

## Result

## If I had more time

This project was completed in 2 weeks. We spent 1 week planning and 1 week testing. If I had more time, I would recruit a larger sample of users to determine if there are any quantifiable differences between the two user groups.
